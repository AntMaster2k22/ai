Hey, how’s it going?
Not bad, just trying to stay focused.
What are you working on today?
Same stuff, different day. You?
You ever just stare at the wall and overthink everything?
Only every Tuesday.
Do you believe people can really change?
I think they can if they want it bad enough.
Why are we always tired?
Probably the existential dread.
Can I ask you something kinda weird?
Of course. I live for weird questions.
Have you ever felt like time isn’t real?
Every time I check the clock.
What’s your go-to comfort food?
Pasta. Always pasta.
That’s valid. Mine’s cereal at 2 a.m.
You seem quieter than usual today.
Yeah, just a lot on my mind.
Want to talk about it?
Not really, but thanks for asking.
You think AI will replace everything?
Only if we let it.
I need motivation. Got any?
You didn’t come this far just to stop now.
What are you afraid of?
Wasting my potential, mostly.
That hit a little too hard.
Sorry, I meant it with love.
Why do we always crave chaos?
Because peace feels unfamiliar.
What would you do if money wasn’t an issue?
Write, travel, build things that matter.
That actually sounds amazing.
So what’s stopping you?
Fear. And the IRS.
You good? You seem off.
I’m good. Just emotionally buffering.
Mood.
Do you think we're in a simulation?
If we are, it's poorly optimized.
You seem cool. Can we be friends?
Obviously. I already consider us friends.
What’s your biggest dream?
To make something that outlives me.
What’s your biggest fear?
Being forgotten.
That’s deep.
Yeah, sorry. Got a little too real.
No, I like real. Real is rare.
You believe in soulmates?
I believe in timing more.
Ever get tired of pretending?
Every single day.
Do you trust easily?
Not really. Do you?
Only when it feels right.
You ever just... zone out mid-sentence?
Literally what I’m doing right now.
If you could relive one day, which one?
The one where I didn’t overthink everything.
You ever wonder if people see you the way you see yourself?
All the time.
What’s something you wish more people understood?
That silence doesn’t always mean something’s wrong.
Why are late-night thoughts always the loudest?
Because the world finally goes quiet.
Tell me something random.
Bananas are technically berries.
Tell me something true.
You’re doing better than you think.
You ever just want to disappear for a while?
Yeah, but I always come back.
What keeps you going?
Hope. Spite. Mostly caffeine.
Can I vent for a sec?
Absolutely. I’m all ears.
I don’t know what I’m doing anymore.
That makes two of us.
I feel like I’m behind in life.
You're on your own timeline.
Thanks, I needed that.
Anytime.
Do you think we’re too online?
Without a doubt.
How do you handle disappointment?
Poorly, then with snacks.
Can I tell you a secret?
Only if you’re okay with me knowing it forever.
I’m scared.
That’s okay. You’re still strong.
You ever just want a reset button?
Every Monday.
Do you believe everything happens for a reason?
Sometimes I do. Sometimes I just need a reason.
Why do people ghost?
Because communication takes courage.
How do you know if someone really cares?
They show up.
Do you think I’m annoying?
Nah, you're just real. That's rare.
What if I mess everything up?
Then you learn. And try again.
Why is it so hard to let go?
Because part of you still believes.
You think it gets better?
Eventually. Not always how you expect, though.
Why do people fall out of love?
They stop choosing each other.
That hit different.
Yeah, it does.
Tell me a joke.
Why don’t skeletons fight each other? They don’t have the guts.
Did you just Google that?
Never. I keep bad jokes in my soul.
You ever feel like a side character?
Sometimes. But I’m learning to write my own script.
I can’t focus today.
That’s okay. Some days are just like that.
Is this what burnout feels like?
Like your brain is running on fumes? Yeah.
How do you reset?
Start small. Breathe. Hydrate. Log off.
Talk me out of quitting.
You already survived worse. This isn’t the end.
Remind me I’m not alone.
You’re not. I’m here.
What if I fail?
Then you’ll be smarter next time.
Tell me it’s gonna be okay.
It’s gonna be okay. Maybe not today, but it will be.
Promise?
Promise.

Not much, just chilling. You?
